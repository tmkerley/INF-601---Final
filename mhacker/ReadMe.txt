### "We’ve only just scratched the surface with this intro (in fact,
 if you’ve read every single word, you’ve read about 5% of the overall
  documentation)." - Django

## A description of what the project is for.

    This website should be able to log your workouts and allow you to access them. 
    There is a growing exercise library. This can be expanded by the admin by running
    the scrip "fixtureUpdater.py" in the terminal with the following command:

        python fixtureUpdater.py

    Later versions will have a goal information, initally linearly improvements, then
    algorithmic.
    In addition, it will build daily sessions as a plan or do a random for the session


## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.
    # Django Installation
    # Source: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/install/

    # Installation
    Python Version
    We recommend using the latest version of Python. Djanog supports Python 3.5
    and newer, however, you will have to pay attention to which Django version
    you use.
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support

    To install Django on Windows, create a project folder:

        >>> mkdir myproject
        >>> cd myproject
        >>> py -3 -m venv venv

    Activate the Virtual Environment(venv):

        >>> venv\Scripts\activate

    Note: execute the following command if there is a permission error within the venv:

        >>> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

    And finally, install Django:

        >>> py -m pip install Django

## Instructions for how people can help.

    provide a rabbithole of a website to go down. Thank you.
